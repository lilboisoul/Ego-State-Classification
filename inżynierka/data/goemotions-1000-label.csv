That game hurt.;4
You do right, if you don't care then fuck 'em!;2
Man I love reddit.;0
[NAME] was nowhere near them, he was by the Falcon. ;2
Right? Considering it’s such an important document, I should know the damned thing backwards and forwards... thanks again for the help!;0
He isn't as big, but he's still quite popular. I've heard the same thing about his content. Never watched him much.;1
"That's crazy; I went to a super [RELIGION] high school and I think I can remember 2 girls the entire 4 years that became teen moms.";3
that's adorable asf;3
"""Sponge Blurb Pubs Quaw Haha GURR ha AAa!"" finale is too real";3
I have, and now that you mention it, I think that's what triggered my nostalgia. ;2
I wanted to downvote this, but it's not your fault homie.;4
BUT IT'S HER TURN! /s;2
That is odd.;1
Build a wall? /jk;2
I appreciate it, that's good to know. I hope I'll have to apply that knowledge one day;0
One time my 1 stopped right in 91st, I was able to get a good photo of the platform since they have some lights along it.;2
Well then I’d say you have a pretty good chance if it’s any girl lol;2
Pretty much every Punjabi dude I've met.;0
For extra measure tape it right by your crotch so she can't take it for sexual assault reasons;1
This video doesn't even show the shoes he was wearing...;2
What does Clemson give pride stickers for? Snaps played?;2
"""You may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make""";0
Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.;0
this definitely fits in r/BoneAppleTea.;2
"""Seeeee! We have one of them coloureds too!""";3
RemindMe! 3 months;2
Yup, not anymore. Keep your blood sugar up! It really helps and DRINK water...;0
Lots, play store or apple store vpn. Nord is good;0
So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.;1
but it's [NAME] saying it so sorta disappointing;2
Something Something Something, space of aids;2
Dark and funny, but not really nice guy. He has yet to call the dead girls whores for declining to sleep with him. ;1
I've probably put a couple hundred miles on my space saver tire. It's still on there right now.;2
I’m glad he’s okay but I’m even gladder it’s not that same gif of the guy ski/parachuting down a mountain;0
nice!! I'll try this one;0
"I can't stand [NAME]. Especially since her ""tatooing my own face"" video. ";1
I just came home, what the fuck is this lineup? I love you [NAME] you mad bastard !!!;0
Go troll elsewhere. This woman needs support, not crass questions.;1
Just rumors online, it most likely won't happen;1
Na. Rediting my post. Sorry for the ignorance.;4
Because the content creators don't deserve to be paid, your seconds spent listening to ads are too valuable!;2
Pity. I had some decent lunches there, but never went there at night.;4
By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet;3
What evidence at all shows that [NAME] was an accomplice?;2
>not a cure-all. Since we don't have such a thing, is this not the next best option?;2
If there’s a pattern, yes.;3
If [NAME] has similar role to end year then no way am I taking those over him ...especially Sony;2
Oh whoops, I misread the original comment;2
Sending love and strength vibes <3;0
She’s like a kewpie doll with them. Precious.;0
Not knowing what it is, for one thing.;2
Thanks for the info mate gonna watch out next time;0
[NAME] is cheaper too. If we would have kept [NAME] we would have had to extend him to over $4mil.;2
Honestly at this point I don't think there's anything that will make me feel better. Maybe down the road, but right now nothing is helping. ;1
There has to be some repercussions for this judge, right? Considering the crimes, that bail seems incredibly low...;1
Good old guardian refusing to accept that [NAME] is stauncly anti-EU and anti-Brussels;1
I don’t even try to make shots like this myself. So I gotta watch other people make them.;4
Me too! First time in a couple of years!;3
Gotta protect’em!;0
Ironic. He could save others from secrecy-enabled corruption, but not himself.;2
This guy is basically the referee in parliament and your right to like him. As for the rest in there thats questionable;2
"""Oh, how DARE you discuss the disgustingly unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle I pursue!"" /s";1
Which totally makes it less funny for a person like me who has never seen this before, and laughed. ;3
Thanks, it was no effort at all.;0
Damn. That’s profound. Did you graduate from Harvard?;3
Nice. I'll look around for it. Thanks!;0
Press fucken charges the moment they use your info.;1
I love this woman.;0
Do you not give your snowmen brooms? I feel like that's a thing people do;1
The service made it 20 years ago (1999, yeah ikr 1999 was 20 YEARS AGO?) ;3
I loved how [NAME] feels like everyone in the office is her family. Her relationship with [NAME] is so cute and innocent;0
Then I’m sorry but this game really isn’t for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.;4
Who exactly are their ‘volunteers’? The IRA?;3
Am I the only INTP here who cared about deadlines. It's how I got so good at crunch time and working last minute.;2
You should dm her and say I'm sorry;2
>Did you just call me a liar? Sick reference.;1
Shut up 15 year-old;1
It doesn't matter. You can pick someone with the #1 Pick that will never be any good...;1
I feel this. For me since I’m using those gamethreads to let out frustration but realistically I know we need to keep patient in this re-rebuild;2
I just got a shirt made that says “I can’t have kids my dog is allergic”;3
I thought it was very good. The guy was one sick bastard that’s for sure.;0
This is kinda cute;0

I wanted to know if there’s was another like meaning to the whole selfie thing not if she liked me or not;3
You're both wrong NBA is an initialism, can't be pronounced as a word. Oh man I love reddit;0
That's why it's only 20$;2
Just wait. Wait for the false promise. Wait for the mandatory prompts. Wait for the empty gestures.;2
Started feeling smug about my short showers but then remembered just how small my water heater is.;0
I didn't like the family ending but I liked the Atlantis ending especially as we know we are going to see more of it in DLC2.;3
Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done.;0
Is he dead now from a tragic drowning accident? Asking for a friend.;4
What? The claim is 2018 best shooters. Not overall best shooters;3
That's professor [NAME] to you, savage!;1
Let go or you will be dragged;0
No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it;0
Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.;4
She wants to connect, alright. With your wallet.;2
That's if you make the smallest payments possible, but if you just need to float a payment, then they will work. ;0
Nice! You and her would get along i bet. She loves her crafty machines and creative people. 😇;2
"[NAME] to [NAME]: ""Don't try and tell me how to defend""";2
Be ready to Experience Canes Hockey;3
I mean that’s a stupid rule that creates an echo chamber, but I don’t see how that belongs here.;1
shockingly close to reality.;2
My fans on patreon will be rewarded soon;2
Hypocritical is pot calling the kettle genocide;1
I love that smile of his!!!!;0
Political affiliations has only little correlation to individual intellectual ability;3
That's just....sorry, but stupid is the only correct word.;0
Omg lala a housewife I can’t even imagine!;2
Love that car;0
Great for him to admit it. Not many people are that humble;0
What does your statement even mean? It's a game set in WW2, not the war itself.;2
You okay?;2
"Looks like a classic subluxation; that guy needs to get to the chiropractor!";0
[NAME] has always favoured [NAME] so I'd assume this means he's the next up, I just prefer [NAME] and find [NAME] a little overrated.;1
It’s the format. It’s like one of those bad [NAME] memes;1
Yes, at home recuperating from a fractured ankle. ;1
Talks of contributing proportionately, wants progressive taxes. Talks of reasonable wants and needs because that’s a slippery term. ;2
Thank you for being willing to learn;0
You should eat real cake today too!;2
It's also had derogatory meaning for nearly 400 years. people with any common sense or taste will generally choose *any* other word.;2
You are correct. But sometimes you might have a plan or you have to improvise. I’m glad it worked.;0
"[NAME]: ""She seems useless""";2
Can you link the apologies? Or do they not actually exist?;3
"Now you ruined the surprise!""";2
*and, sorry for the spelling mistake;4
Think you mean this Labour MP;2
How many kids do you see? xıs :ɹǝʍsuɐ;3
Funny, the right only seems to say this about women and people of color 🤔🤔🤔;3
Great! Can't wait :);3
I can't believe he got it while getting man-handled by two players!!;4
I have already, what's your point? ;2
[NAME] just needs to split it up more resting him earlier;2
He’s been going to a restaurant for 40 years and forgot what it looked like and where it was.. uh huh.;4
Cant wait to hear a hot take from the second dumbest people who ever loved ([NAME] ots the first if you are asking);3
Umm... I do it everyday since I was 13 and I’m fine... could be just me...;2
Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.;0
Yeah, I read that the first time. Nobody is forcing you, other than yourself.;2
yo STOP going on your roof on dxm man you don't want to fall and hurt yourself;0
Then YOU go right ahead...support and guide him.;3
Lmao you fart bigger to cover up the first one;3
KILLING IN THE NAME OF;2
Lol. Build your own or make some tweaks to the printer.;1
I've never seen him play so hard on defense. This feels different this time is all I'm saying...;4
This is r/tifu. If you're not caught jacking it into the turkey, you're doing it wrong. ;3
Got it! Thank you!;0
[NAME] the people must be warned.;2
So using your figures here we make £12 billion in tax from the EU company's selling in to the uk. We save a further £9billion on fees to the EU;3
Gotta eliminate the competition. It's Just Good Business.;0
Lol I hate this too!;3
Ones with close ties to SA, anyway. An escaped apostate won't exactly be itching to run home.;1
how does asperger feel like;3
You're welcome :);0
I'd watch it without a doubt. I'm especially interested in the different Tracer playstyles, because the only one I know is dive.;2
I really like this ring so I’m glad to hear that.;3
The [NAME] are all laughing at each other. They are divided. We need to strike them down while they are weak.;3
Allow me to describe the shock and awe I experienced seeing this: **Fuck no why u do this?**;1
Integrated, Antwaarps speaking, second generation, not already wearing a scarf back then... unlikely. ;1
Rahway Mechanical LLC should be able to. Great guy;0
Be careful with the Washington Times. It's not exactly the Washington Post.;2
Ending the quarter with some point [NAME] action, I love it ;0
Also Republicanism is a belief system. It's taught and handed down like religion. Conservative talk radio is its evangelism.;3
his traps hide the fucking sun.;1
Only thing TO know is that this motherfucker is obviously living his best birdy life and good for him. Fly high little buddy, fly high. ;1
I love this sub reddit 😍😂;0
>fail at reading comprehension >Other guy must be a troll ¯_(ツ)_/¯;1
The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!;0
is a recent article interesting read.;2
I found that after particularly bad games I feel the “need” to smoke more weed, like a cigarette after a carcrash IMO;0
Sure but what are you basing that off of? If [NAME] is the best jump-ball receiver, wouldn't that make him the best red zone receiver?;2
...by the same person even;2
I don’t think they really thought through the ramifications of putting a bunch of angry women through rigorous physical exercise with weapons. That uprising would be glorious!;0
Sorry just seemed like you were trying to make it a [NAME] thing;4
Iq designed by the military to see who would be the best pencil pusher subordinates;2
People who hate [NAME] really really hate him. It’s quite fascinating.;2
RTD lines are free in Denver tonight. Stay safe.;2
It's a tool that idiots install so they can tag users who post in subreddits they disagree with and immediately discount or attack said users;2
"Without fail saying ""moist panties"" makes every woman cringe.";2

I feel like I saw this literally last week, these reposts are getting adventurous lads ;2
Thank you for your open mind. Stay strong, fight the good fight, and stay educated.;0
They’re looking at her like they wish they’d ordered her instead.;2
This is why you play runescape as a kid, it teaches how to trust no one that offers free rune plate trimming;2
[NAME] lol. I eat what I want.;2
Thank you. People always forget that The Happiest Days of Our Lives is essentially part of that song.;0
Drunk and crying in bed with my pets. :|;4
Especially with the way they got rid of him... no real fanfare at all...;3
I just heal and when we start to do bad day its my fault taking blame off of our flanks and frontlines;2
So basically nowhere near the consensus required for a united Ireland. If a no-deal Brexit happens we can see.;2
So wrong. Most every denomination believes they are the only ones who are doing it right and everyone else is going to rot in hell.;1
Just got back from TWC, and they were great! Thank you. 90% they were fried. Will try these others next ;0
Something's wrong. The top post on r/conspiracy isn't completely anti-conspiracy? Wow, feels weird. /s(?);2
I bought the double barrel and fully upgraded it and now it's one of my favorite guns.;0
Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.;4
What makes you say that?;1
Second, you accuse everyone who didn't ignore you of being a Russian propaganda poster;1
"No, you are just suggesting someone be at the ""perfect"" level of looking for a relationship. Suggesting someone be the perfect anything is just sillyness. ";2
Go play Farmville if you can't keep it up.;1
Hmmm I dont think I listen to only [NAME] if I last checked. These arent INTP playlists they're just playlists I like as an INTP;1
I think the Chiefs need to get [NAME] so their defense is weak enough for us to beat them;2

This is me and my wife. She squeals with delight whenever it snows and I start looking for property in Arizona.;0

I wanna die!;0
Fucking monophanie looking ass floating with the dead, nice.;0
No worries! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have! :);0
You’re right. My biggest pet peeve is the lights, it washes out all the colors and textures, I hate that BGs use them;1
>The ABC’s hard-hitting investigation :/ Such a sad article.;4
And only $300+ a night, beautiful but expensive.;2
Y'all really out here supporting authoritarian Venezuelan dictators huh.;2
I'll add to this: be prepared to not get closure or questions answered. This is the hardest lesson I had with my break up.;2
Exactly. Stop talking and let the adults speak u/MeatheadVernacular.;3
Thanks for contributing to the advertising;0
Great start to the post-All-Star game part of the campaign!;0
All the signs, except his username, seemed legit. I also clicked. Now I just want to forget all about what I've just seen...;0
Would you rather I hadn't posted this article? Don't want to talk about it?;1
Hand ur phone to a buddy and let them send the text asking her out. Worst thing is she says no, but it's better then not knowing ;1

Awkwardly remembering all of those promises I made mid-panic attack...;3
"[NAME] to [NAME]: ""Don't try and tell me how to defend""";2
Now I'm wondering if [NAME] drinks, and if he's ever been inebriated during one of his deals.;3
That’s what’s it’s called or what SHE’S called?🤣;3
Ya I thought that was odd too. I would’ve guessed [NAME] before doing this.;1
Don't understand the question. Obviously you make up the rules in the middle of the game.;1
Ive already tried praying for vagina - you will find me on my knees LOL;0
How fortunate you're able to whine about it without being censored...;2
Disgusting!!! Where were the adults? The adults probably felt proud of their sons. Fucken toxic culture;1
that most of the fandom does not get that reference is depressing;4
It's always been Marfeles. Was 30 years ago when I first visited.;3
same here OP, reading some of these stories makes me want to hug my DM for being a decent human being as well as a solid DM;3
That's awesome!! Look forward to watching this kids progress in year 2;0
"Thats not him :( the most recent comment literally starts with ""i'm not a dude"" ";2
Hey now, don’t try to have the guy killed. This is an upstanding sub. ;1
The simple ones feel elegant.;2
That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?;2
Looks like complete slop with 4 turds thrown on top. 🤢;1
Got it, thanks for clearing it up.;0
The ending was awesome;0
No going back after switching to a safety razor. Even the most expensive blades are 10x+ cheaper than Gillette.;1
Can't wait to move out of the city so I can get a gun. No gun city living sucks;2
I thought I was the only one;2
He's just a money grabbing midget;2

Im 13 I can't get a job..;4
I'm just saying you are demanding things of us while being nasty yourself.;1
Yes, you said you are dying, I cannot do anything about that, hope you find peace;0
From what the experts say his chances are like 0 so 🤷🏻‍♂️.;2
I really love that game devs are started to put these references in games.;0
Look [NAME], those curly q's on your face make me so hot I can't think straight.;1
Opposing ethnonationalism and private property is hardly a weird hill for an anarchism to defend;3
Well they called and said there was a pricing discrepancy and they could not honor it. 😭 sad day.;4
It's the great irony of The Resistance©. It's hard to be a rebel when most of the powerful institutions of the country are on your side;3
Did you noticed they removed my post? Yep.;1
"play who you find fun, ""tiers don't matter""";2
Ah yes, the poison. The worst part of any poisoning. ;1

Sacrifice them to [NAME];2
Man I hate kids;1
[NAME] bringing on Sir [NAME] to confront [NAME] about calling him fat is a great interview;2
Yeah I know, it’s just wishful thinking but I would be ecstatic if it came out today;3
They know a lot of people aren't paying attention to the quieter news that doesn't get sensationalized;2
It's good worrying about things that can be helped. Lol;0
In my experience its always [NAME]' Mine;0
My mistake. I just glanced over your last post.;4
[NAME] damn it I'm so tired of seeing Instagram between fights;1
Well being told from a young age that us chubby dudes are not allowed to get the girl ever. Thats is why im asking.;3
Fantasize about violence then go home and pretend to be an edgy badass on Reddit.;2
You guys are so cute together! Good luck with the de-stressing!;0
Ugly truth is, if you didnt want to be stopped you wouldnt tell anyone. It will pass. Stay strong :);2
The rest of the starting QBs.;2
I know the feeling, but you’re not disgusting. Happy new year!;0
You’re thinking agnosticism, atheism is a faith based position ;3
Gotta go fast! [NAME];3
Would feel weird swiping right on a leftie;1
They’d be stupid to trade AB. Let’s all calm down and just ignore the media and let this thing die down.;2
"TL;DR No more Superbowls for [NAME]. Get ready for another winning season that ends in disappointment.";4
There's not enough salt in the world for her!;1
They have THE BEST tortillas too. Made right in front of you. Mmmmmm!;2

It’s not so much the heat, it’s the humidity that’ll kill you.;0
Why is [NAME] smile at the beginning the best part of this whole thing?!;3
Who still unironically says SJWs? You look like an idiot saying that.;1
“I genuinely don’t want to lose you I love having you there for me” says it all really;3
For real! It was like a shining beacon in the night!;3

"""Sponge Blurb Pubs Quaw Haha GURR ha AAa!"" finale is too real";3
Man.. all I know is if I’m with a girl and she whips out a condom from her FUCKING SHOE it’s a no from me dog;1
I guess I’ll stay friends with her. Heck I’m a guy I can take a hit if she wouldn’t date;0
Oh that's lovely.;0
I'm really worried :( I sent a DM to them, I hope they will be okay... ;0
I have considered that, and if is possible, I will see where it leads me, thanks.;0
Anybody think maybe we’re the mystery team in on [NAME]? At this point I wouldn’t be surprised.;3
Dear OP: Proper punctuation please/thank you.;0
Yes. One of her fingers is getting a sore on it and there’s concern it may push her into needing braces.;2
They all have these same moronic talking points that they memorized. It's hilarious. I hear them all the time;3
Right? The dollar values just double and two daily doubles.;3
That’s not true. She represents those who voted her into power.;1
I'm so fucking dead!!!!!!!💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣;4
BUT WHY DOES SHE DO A FULL FACE/EYE LOOK THEN SKIP THE MASCARA?!?!! This has been driving me nuts.;2
“Stop. What are you doing? Stop.” 😂;3
I give 90 percent odds that [NAME] will be reelected. And I think it will be at a much higher margin than 2016.;3
Wow I bet someone would look at this and get inspired to make a movie about aliens with [NAME];0
FLY EAGLES FLY!!!;2
You're both wrong NBA is an initialism, can't be pronounced as a word. Oh man I love reddit;0

I think: Congrats! That baby will now have loving parents;0
That’s me! Got it at the sens store by 304;3
That almost makes her seem like an actual human being.;4
Don’t know why I didn’t think of that..but hey thanks, hero!;0
"And when the humane society euthanizes perfectly healthy animals, are they also doing it so that ""people can no longer use them""?";2
Nice try GRU.;2
Damage values would be fantastic. I also really appreciate having detailed kit information. We no longer use attachments so listing specializations would be nice.;0
No it hasn't.;1
Been spot on so far.;4
Ahhh. A civil and interesting conversation on the internet. How refreshing.;2
I have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.;1
IMO the car was mostly at fault for abruptly jumping into the other lane without signaling.;2
Post saved! That looks like a great exercise to try, thank you. ;0
Ignorance is strength.;2
This. I relate to this. So much. Almost too much.;2

TBH I would definitely wear this with my denim jacket, but I wouldn't buy a huge lathe and carving tools to make it. ;3
State of [NAME] trying to be funny and spelling ‘lose’ wrong;1
>They split up 5 years later after an extremely messy situation with Dr [NAME]. Very very long story. I would like to hear this story;0
Have a look at the decks from the latest weplay tournament and if there’s anything you like the look of.;3
"I am glad I found this subreddit ""gatekepping"" is a phenomenon vocab btw.";0
I don't really know how to explain because English is not my first language, I'm sorry.;2
I always thought of the sound of lakes freezing on cold nights. It's pretty surreal in itself.;3
That sucks! Your lady giblets are NONE of her damn business. Does your BF at least try to curb her mouth?;1
Everything was flagged as adult so there wouldn't have been much left;3
dude people here can be assholes. there’s nothing wrong with taking a break.;1
Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat;4
I was aware I would be going to hospital and would be showing the teacher up (should have mentioned it);2
An innie?;2
You will miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, you just gotta take a chance and see.;0
[NAME] was far from an assassin. She had one amazing performance but that was it.;0
What a wonderful world;0
No, because asses that hot don't come in trenta;2
NO MAN LEFT BEHIND;2
This sounds dumb but do I worry about [NAME] value at all if [NAME] is a [NAME]? Obviously I steel keep [NAME].;2
It was a poor choice of words.;1
"My dad makes that joke ""I have to fight anorexia"", his BMI is 31...";3
Oh wow I love this!;0
I like hearing about these positive encounters.;3
I ate 2 lots of rice a day, with chilli. I also had a bowl of high carb cereal. I lost 4stone. CICO, is real! ;2
I like seeing this. There is hope. I want to hug this guy. He'll be allright.;0
Lets just say its probably cheaper to just hope a more positive outlook reflects on your out-look.;0
Where is this suggestion, the only one I know is to check if you video has the dreaded yellow $ sign. ;2
He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!;1

Meaning of life is to work 8h + a day and then convert your lifetime in coins you can spend on useless shit.;2
Just got my seats a couple of days ago!;2
Maybe [NAME] needs to have a Big Mac meal and relax.;0
CURRY MY MAN;2
We've had so many stories about [NAME], that we do NOT need any about Florida lady. LOL;2
Yes the ammo health thing really is a chore. Too much realism. we want have some fun in a realistic setting, not a simulator. ;1
2013 was Dunk City, right? Because that was incredible ;0
Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.;1
Self-deprecating humor is mainstream now. A lot of hot people now have hobbies and personality traits that were once almost synonymous with dumpy/nerdy/ugly people.;1
You should have noped out of the whole thing the moment the racist with a racist character came into the picture.;1
That's not even deconstructed. It's just unassembled.;2
That is a great video;0
AWWWWW, look at the little snowflake that can’t take cyberbullying and thinks others care!;1

This is just a terrible joke;1
This is a slippery slippery slope that ends with the backstory to the Wrath of Khan dude.;2
I've been watching too much my 600lb life...I instantly hear dr. [NAME];4
Noooo... Went and saved all the webpages as PDFs, though it's not a perfect solution.;2
Can you snap a picture of that pinky in your butthole, friend? ;3
Looks gorgeous on u 😍😍;0
Counteracting my cold soul takes sacrifice;3
Oh no [NAME] bb what is you doin?;0
There it is. I knew I wasn't the only one bothered by this.;3
Destroying the unrighteous to save the righteous is a righteous act. Therefore the great flood is an act of love. Whether it happened or didn't happen.;3
Please tell me how you feel about [NAME] and [NAME] again once you've finish with your manufactured outrage.;0
Filthy birdbrain-loving scum barely deserve the bullets needed to boot them off the mountain. Moreiya 4 life;0
I think the one thing we can all agree on is Kill Mikol. This was too difficult to answer in full..;2
Holy crap, I've never seen a picture of [NAME] so thin.;4
I would’ve LOVED to be a part of something like this as a kid!!;0
Why is it so hard for people to accept the word no? Jfc. She definitely deserved what she got lol.;3
Wow, the Wizards are horrible ;4
Bro, it's only game, why you heff to be mad?;2
Makes my skin crawl;1
Too busy being on that stupid ass mystery singer show;1
"That would be my next bumper sticker ""Proudly antisocial"".";2
This same problem exists in playground as well.;3
Not really sure we could get salary's to match up;2
yep, i think you should just try to be as honest as you can about how you feel, how it affects your daily life, etc;0
ORaNgE MaN bAd AnD iS HiTlEr!!!! EvErYoNe I dOnT lIkE iS HiTlEr!;1
Only the [NAME] do so. The rest of us have been exasperated with him for months, at least.;2
You are my beer god thank you haha;0
It was 90 degrees;2
You’re gonna let him go without unmasking him??;2
"Lol I was just about to protest ""you can't know that!"" until I realized.....";2
This is actually so funny, this is something id expect from Australian sports media since we're shit at broadcasting but lmao;3
A volley into a header. Just wow. The skills.;2
I can feel my left knee getting sore now;2
Geez those heroes..;3
"I knew I didn't like this guy when the NPR commentator said ""He's the best option for attorney general right now""";0
"""look at you... look at you..!"" Oh, I'm bawlin. ";3
Not seeing why that's depressing.;2
Thanks! Need to rewatch the series soon;0
oh my [NAME]. it was hurting my brain. i only saw the disappearing boot and thought i was missing something.;1
I thought that was a good pickup line;4
The positive side to this is i get to relive the same emotions that I felt losing my virginity....ever few months.;0

I *want* to like R&M but people are making it really difficult;1
Well, it feels like the other truths would be more pertinent. If they don’t know what it is, then what is it?;2
Fake news! Obviously this can't be true, as everyone can clearly see the angelic halo above [NAME] head. ;2
Thank you for the new obsession.;0
Not significantly bigger. UK is approximately the same size in terms of land mass as Romania right? Which isn't significantly bigger than Syria.;2
This just makes me feel inferior at this point.;4
Solid argument. Honestly this game’s a mess and impossible to balance for both sides equally.;0
That's got nothing to do with anything that's happened in this thread;1
love you comrade! <3 you should get a cool flair too;0
Thank you. I’ve got till next week to find out then :);0

You're delusional and unabashedly willing to lie about others for ideological reasons.;2
Damn. You sure showed me.;2
All the replies take his quote a little too seriously;1
She is probably cheating on you. :(;4
My two favorite channels are Inner Integration and From Surviving to Thriving. Both have many videos, and they really get it.;2
But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!;4
You mean, their gender. And no, we really just do as much as cis person.;2
4. Go out and show [NAME] is still a stud and free agents should want to come here and play with our young core;2
So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!;3
iT cAn'T bE sExISt bEcAuSE iT's a mErItocRaCy. -tech bro assholes justifying gender discrimination and systemic sexism;1
Whenever you get a smelly one, don't you feel ashamed? Like what disgusting thing did I do wrong?;0
I LITERALLY SAID THAT TO MY FRIEND;2
I waited outside tj outside for 10 min and did my whole shopping experience in a wine that started at the beginning of the store;2
I didn't delete it. Your moderators did. But that's what [NAME] do, they ;1
This is what you get for starring in a mediocre movie;1
I was convinced that you can just use one of the above. If you clean up just like the truck in the back of one person beat him.;2

Who’s vid is This?;3
If reincarnation is real, I hope next time I have a name that's half as awesome as [NAME].;0
Jfc, that's depressing.;1
People have made money off it. Belle Delphine was hit with a $60,000 fine recently;2
#IDidNotVoteForThisClown!;1
Why do they always threaten with a block? Like how do they not see that’s not a threat that’s a solution?;2
So it isn’t pretty much the same? Glad you think I’m right then.;0
There is a steam game about this called 'Not Tonight'.;2
Clever!!!;0
That does help a bit, thanks.;0
Or you have msdn;3
That is great insight. Once mom is against you, you’re done. ;3
Why did I get a boner reading this? That Magnesium supplement is doing its job methinks;2
You know what you’re right, not with risking my CC info. Good thing I was too lazy to do it right away. ;3
At least he's finally done one thing right. Utter fucking disappointment at every level, by every metric.;4
Glad to help!;3
They probably have a couple years to prepare unfortunately.;2
Depends, do you become so old and senile that you have dementia can’t walk and shit;1

I cheered for the Superbowl to be canceled;2
Oh fuck I almost forgot to jerk off and smoke weed today. I'm so forgetful. Appreciate the reminder.;1
If she loves the place she’s at why leave? There’s something to be said for that. Idk your all’s financial situation tho;3
All true, but [NAME] only “retired” to get out of AZ. Now that he’s back looking for a job...;2
Oh to find someone who loves you enough to put a blanket over you when you’re sleepy. That’s the dream.;2
I will check him out thank you :);0
Can't jab him outta this wind up unblockable lol;3
Ahh mate, come back any time and i'll make culturally inappropriate Third Reich gags and then we can get lit on bush chooks.;1
So he’s gonna swear at you in Klingon?;3
Im color blind, i usually see blue as purple and red as green soo...;4
Anybody know why [NAME] sat the second half? It wasn't like anybody else was burning it up.;2
What state and what size of city? Im curious if it's inner city of small town;3
Doesn’t matter does it? It’s a joke. No need to get a designer/graphic artists involved to communicate the idea.;3
Good to know ED either doesn’t affect this guy or he’s projecting hard because it’s the worst thing he can try to handle;0
Sucks for that guy;2
I got through it when I got home, thanks! :);0
Oh you'd prefer if I used this pic instead? I understand.;2
I said stop though. What’s with right wingers and not understanding consent?;1
If he was a rap ‘musician ‘ then I’m all in favour.;2
I’d rather reply to you, simply because you sound like an idiot;1
Yeeeaaaah, move out and keep showing off the clam.;2
Are you a twink?;2
I cringed so much just reading that tweet, I didn't even make it to the comments. That's my fucking President. :(;4
My wife is out for shabbos and I'm so lonely without her :(;4
Having two world class GKs is amazing lol;0
): hope the goose is okay ):!;0
I see. Thanks again for taking the time. I'm very isolated from the world so It's good to finally talk to someone about those things.;0
>more money than you I seriously, *seriously* doubt that. >doing something before this guys are outta the country Prove it.;1
Roll on 5pm till i sit in bumper to bumper traffic until about 7pm when i can finally roll into lisburn;2
Only blurred photos, but could be something I suppose. Here's to hoping;0
if it wasn't him it would be someone else she's wasting her life on;1
Unfortunate for him, but I'm bringing up players. >AND they can just stop being a support.;4
Not in Missouri according to my friend who moved up there;1
This is absolutely perfect;0
If it’s not raining, then GoBike is great. Only $15 for a month. ;0
Yeah it doesn't impact much except when they break and cause billions of dollars in damages and irreparable consequences to the wildlife.;1
Or don't notify the boss, and keep not singing Happy birthday in restaurants. (Maybe I'm just no fun?);2
Do you have a link to any news or something? I'd love to read more about it.;0
>Playing competitive MTG has brought me as much joy as my children. Yeah this conversation is over;2
Sounds like you are the one with salty tears mate;1
I always suggest Laser Quest downtown, it's a blast!;3
Oh so that’s what you are into huh?;2
My turn should arrive this year. At least this place will allow me to leave my last words.;2
You'll miss a begging old man asking for a spare coin. RIP;4
He has a kid that he pays child support and my 2 younger siblings that he also calls leeches;2
Im really sad, and there is alot more goin on but i dont know how to tell it.;4

My nipples are rock hard right now, just ruined my shirt. ;1
What kind of insider only has 250 followers?;2
Lol good talk;0
And now you manage a gym on base ..or..?;3
Sometimes, a shirt is just a shirt. Do you have any reason to believe otherwise?;2
"I’m interested in the tactics and positional play lmao ;)";3
I swear of all the people that dislike artifact, the gwent crew is by far the most obnoxious.;1
Yep, it would be super easy. Honestly makes me regret not doing that to the flames sub... /S kind of;3
Doesn't even make sense. You don't say dollars 5 so why put the dollar sign in front;1
I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.;1
Dude, I'll be your friend any time. Especially if you got Steam/discord. I will link u to our friend group's server.;0
I didn't know that newborn babies eat and breathe through an umbilical cord. TIL.;2
Nobody forced [NAME] to take [NAME] over [NAME], if he liked him that much then he should’ve just taken him.;0
Wow, way to be gorgeous as yourself!;0
See but it’s so common an attitude that it didn’t come off that way;1
There have been some really good replies in this thread, I hope they help you too! :);0
Yes thank you;0

I’m so sorry. You deserve so much better.;4
Thank you! We’re currently shoveling ourselves out of the driveway, hopefully well be going there soon;0
This sub is becoming a “Gamers rise up” parody of itself. This is ridiculous.;1
If you had a giant rock on your land, and you couldn't stop people climbing, wouldn't you be pissed?;1
Oh then u/Dr-Pepper-Phd;2
Brutal piece!;1
Oh hey, the actual answer;2
The old bear;2
There is no doubt in my mind that [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] will start tomorrow. Unsure about the rest;2
Yeah, [NAME] stans cannot get enough of it. In their little bubble [NAME] can outsmart a queen with experience in dealing with petty people. ;3
This is the noise I make in my girlfriend’s ear while y’all are still scared to moan;3
Yea I’m into this I guess. So thanks for that(?);0
I'm sorry that's what you read because it isn't what I said.;4
Certainly possible. I think you can wait until 15 but that's just a gut thing.;2
I have never noticed dread doing shady stuff. Dream, well, duh.;2
One of the gayest shirts I have ever seen...;3
Yes, that's an interesting thing that I've been curious about ever since the merger. And the new party has pretty much purged the Wildrosers.;3
Would be a good idea what deal labour wants.;2
> [NAME] huh she hasn't even cast a vote on anything yet, you can't just apply your preconceived biases onto a person without a voting record;2
Not this sub’s fault the ((([NAME]))) is full of idiots;1
> It's upsetting. What can be done? We'll have to take it to the high courts, let them decide!;2
Okay I’ll call them tonight and cry on your behalf.;4
[NAME] damn it;1
I’m glad you are here. You got this.;3
Not just commercial property owners. Large stakeholders such as HOAs of condo owners were also involved.;2
You’re not going to convince anyone else either if you refuse to back up any of your claims.;2
I once had a guy yell something obscene from the window of his truck and throw a half full beer can at me too... good times;3
"The ""dad"" in that Pizza Hut commercial looks weird af";4
I very happy with my character. I took my sweet ass time picking one that I liked.;3
Is there a customer service number? If so, what is it?;2
But pretty much the entire Torah is in masculine language. Weak argument on their part.;2
I had forgotten it was coming up until I saw this. That us my level of excitement and anticipation.;2
Lol, good luck with that, kid.;0
Look at that shit-eating grin;1
She did that on purpose look at her feet shift over before she throws the punch.;2
Bless you.;0
WHO WON THIS FIGHT My thoughts: neither side did a good job at explaining their positions and this entire interview was mostly useless;4
Yeah it’s not like I want my cat to lick me in a sexual way that’s just weird.;1
Yes it is child abuse. It’s sexist too.;4
Rollin the green for 48 hours, weed will make you feel like you got awesome powers, like flight.;0
Welcome to the new normal.;0
Sometimes, I feel bad if I don't every now and then. I mostly talk with her on SC/IG tho. ;4
Enfp male here, I would love to find an INTJ girl and see if it works, which people tell me it could! ;0
"I love how you're getting downvoted for understanding ENTPs better than the ""ENTPs"" in this thread.";0
So true it hurts.;4
Ah I didn't know that. I meant this [NAME] ad:;2
Not look much beautiful.;1
So what I'm hearing is your dad didn't do a good job ~~brainwashing~~ raising you :-P;2
Like [NAME] said at the very end of the stream, “You’re still here and you can still do amazing things.”;0
My dude looks like he's done with this WWE business;2
Not probable, I study in the best university in my country, I don't want to stop at all;0
Man hope he recovers fast. Looked really painful;2
He did get 3 stars bro😭;2
I think I’ll go ahead and continue criticizing silly unfounded and harmful beliefs;0
I know but for that one moment he was more than that guy who snuck in [NAME] room at night and wore his helmet;2
I, too, have lied about getting hooked up by Hasbro to justify the unhealthy amount of money I have spent on Nerf guns. ;2
[NAME] gives me the weirdest boner. I love these guys;0
Oh I’m sorry. I assumed. I think that would be suspicious if your username was known to someone else.;2
That is definitely an unpopular opinion. Upvoted.;3
He is going to hate 2019...;1
Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]...;1
If at first you don’t succeed...welp, nevermind.;1
Fidget spinners are cool again;2
You're gullible enough to believe them.;1
Was that a thing? Please tell me this was not a thing.;2
Morals aren't tied to religiosity, nor the absence of it.;1
Awesome, thanks. Great answer.;0
Sorry to hear that, I have it for ps4 and hardcore dlc servers are still up;2

Hahaha. One of those rare moments when a reddit title makes me laugh out loud.;3
I agree.;3
Have a great weekend;2
Looks really good! TY! Will watch it tonight;0
Im sure you’ll love it;3
I would tell her part of loving herself/her body is taking care of herself. Speaking as a recovering obese person myself.;2
Yeah personally I would’ve brought [NAME] back lol [NAME] always had trouble staying healthy;2
"What are you talking about? This sub defended ""it's just camo ,it's realistic"". [NAME] including myself all begged for better visibility lmao ";3
What campaign? He is already president.;0
Thanks man, I managed to feel better by letting loose with some music - definitely a *much* better way to pull out of a dive. ;0
All ur damage should have overflowed.. So just choose the best looking one.;3
I’m not usually into ASMR, but I’ll look into it! Thank youu;0
Sorry, girl. You deserve better.;2
Omg this is great.;0
Are you this awful about everything that isn't your own preference?;1
What’s the motive for doing this? To save on fuel by transporting as many people as possible in one go?;3
[NAME] looks veeeery nervous;2
I wouldn’t recommend expensive brands in this subreddit. People get irrationally angry and condescending.;1
will watch the films, thanks for the recommendation ;0
He’d definitely get dropped at some point and then all hell will break loose;4
It's not even Goats. Just got to the point I realised the Devs don't care about what happens below high elo.;2
Good dad, manipulative son.;0
What a homie.;2
oh [NAME] I unleashed the beast;2
>Working in MD AND DC? Would this be illegal? I will do that, thanks!;0
I'm just now going through the replies on this thread. This is the first person I've looked up on Spotify. Thank u for the recommendation!;0
Ah ok, that makes more sense. I don’t think most [NAME] would see your last name and try to make it French, lol.;1
I can’t imagine having a plan B when it comes to dating. That just seems disrespectful to not devote yourself to the person your dating.;1
You need medical help.;0
My 2 best girls in the series combined into one and [NAME] with [NAME] colors is so beautiful :);0
Beard length 10;2
Midnight has been 4/4 pro league teams they have played so far, so I wouldn't be too sure they're gonna be bottom feeders;1
That’s always my worst fear when the idea of leaving during January comes up. I wish you the best of luck in unthawing them!;0
Been there, done that. Still alive and remarkably healthy at 51. The body is tremendously resilient;0
That’s the hardest part for some to get over, but hobbies help and getting yourself up and out of the house and spending time with friends;3
Playing the golden oldies eh?;3
Same. Even though he’s dad-dicked us 3 years in a row I will always cheer for [NAME].;2
Well, I’ll be here when you fail!;0
My goodness. Your such a fucking manchild.;1
brooks running shoes and you will never have a sore back or feet in your life again;2
Damn. r/murderedbywords;1
it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.;2
This is an attempted genocide. Genocide happens because of those seeking power, not because of religion or ethnicity or college educations. ;2
Basically. My step dad didn't choose to break his back and his knees. The whale chose to overeat and become obese;2
Now change the guys face to [NAME] and you are golden.;2
remind me of this kid. Young people just being innocent on the internet;2
Why do we gotta wait for a week just for the devs to fix their mistake?;3
If someone calls I will text them and say I can't talk right now. No matter what I'm doing.;0
I would think: Thank [NAME] it's finally happening;0
cool... Sorry bro;4
I’ve legitimately never heard anything about disabled men relying on prostitution, nor have I heard any arguments using disabled men as a rationalization for prostitution.;2
Wow excellent shot;0
Love the guy complaining the panel is stacked against the rich what with all the high tax rhetoric. *The WORLD is stacked against the rest of us.*;2
Why do some people use tbh after everything;2
I am already using ublock. Thank you for suggesting ghostery, didn't know it.;0
I've had a crown and bracelets made for me with old ad. Glad I'm not alone;0
she has a lot of lore, read the comics. and yes she's the best designed character from MKX along with [NAME] and maybe kotal;2
Verisimilitude, which here means, utter bs meant to help justify terrible favouritism.;2
> Love is more important than some job. You can't be serious? Please tell me you're just joking.;3
it grows on you, fresh packs of creme are actually pretty tasty and they hit right ;0
this is so niche but i still felt that shit in my bones;1
Good lad!;0
**You are breaking the car!**;1
... [NAME] derangement syndrome sufferer spotted. What drivel you crazy lunatics say... The lies and falsehoods along with the out of place fearmongering is getting really annoying...;1
It’s possible that the dog just escaped. Especially since it might be excited by the massive crowd running;3
Ugh. The Google Plus BB community is the absolute worst!!!;4
If you had a giant rock on your land, and you couldn't stop people climbing, wouldn't you be pissed?;2
Haha, nice try mom. *dabs*;0
Not everyone has given up on Wigs. We’re much better off staying the course.;2
If you have to do side task you consider boring in order to power up and take on the main quest I'd consider that grinding.;0
But all-Korean teams don't always do the best in OWL/Contenders, look at Outlaws v. Seoul, etc... ;1
Why are you nervous about getting fired if you aren’t doing anything wrong? If I were an employer firing an employee would be my last resort.;2
They can lock the doors all they want, unless they have the child locks turned on there's nothing stopping me from unlocking the door. ;3
ohhh....;2
i say no or in da club if they come to damce with me i walk away;1
> We're angry, but we don't want to be labelled as violent nutters.;1
lmao okay dude;3
Damn. I want to see some of those comments!;1
When did you apply for this? The new AFI was published Oct of 2018. Have you already PCSed from Korea?;2

Men don’t have it worse but at least society cares about women.;1
yeeey [NAME], My purpose has been fulfilled Now I must go;0
Rheged sounds like a racist name for a [NAME]. Don't think it will catch on tbh;3
I've had a crown and bracelets made for me with old ad. Glad I'm not alone;3
He’s only caught herpes twice.;2

Well 216 is out now and Im crying. [NAME] why?;2
The only one I'd recomend is [NAME] to be honest;3
I got a free Razor for being a student so I'm a net loss on their company :D;3
To clear his name I guess. If he’s actually innocent this will be vindicating;2
She completely understands, that's why she does this.;2
They look so soft and comfy.;3
Poor Target didn’t make enough millions during one of the most hectic Christmas seasons I recall in almost 2 decades. Gotta save that payroll though.;0

How do you plan on taking care of 2 infants at the age of 18? What about the third one?;3
How many guys did they have on IR? I think their top 2 lineman at each spot were out at least. Hell, they almost beat us.;3
[NAME], too. [NAME] is very guilty of this.;4
Can’t fault you there;4
So the watering down continues. When will the democrats stop losing the battle before it's fought?;2
Being in FL keeps most of the cold at bay, but I've been layering for the last couple days.;2

I tripped off 540mg of Robocough and my oil pen last night. It was absolutely wild like damn;2

So, the cops raided my favorite massage parlor today.;1
I can respect profiting from morons.;3
I find it really strange how people align themselves with or against a politician so strongly.;0

> laughing me off. > can’t expect everyone to be current on every topic;3
Plot twist: [NAME] is [NAME] estranged father;2
Please stop uploading twitter links. There's a reason people ask for/post mirrors.;1
Good on you dude. I'm west coast, but I'd love if anyone ever finds themselves in Seattle, I extend this offer.;3
"And of course, instead of calling out the men responsible for this behavior, the ""Not all men"" crowd has arrived in full force.";3

Thing is, some fans will *never* be happy. There is nothing that can be done to please them. That's the problem.;4
Behavior I'd consider deeply immoral without showing true remorse (I'm talking rape, torture of animals, that sort of thing).;2
"That sounds awful )-: I'm so grateful that my parents and therapist want to let me figure this out with minimal ""supervision""";0
They're playing on their phone and smoking in the toilet too. That's how they take a break. I'd rather take a walk outside personally;2
You actually have a point. But I think as long as they both dont have an issue atm it should be okay.;3
Idk if I’m wrong but I think they gave her some piercings on her ear which are cool too;3

She's a ~~chill cat~~ woman of few words.;3

Easy money, thank you [NAME];0
They probably take slight step back, by that I mean still the best defense in the league, but closer.;3
I agree with that sentiment. But Doordash is not a job worth doing. I worked for less than minimum wage all summer.;2
Looking cool [NAME];0
It was a very faithful remake, though. They just crashed the plane without planning out what to do next.;0
I was only thinking of the players that were drafted. [NAME] is a UDFA GOAT.;2
If you kill a spider instead of putting it outside, you are a grade A bitchmade babyman.;2
This dude was joking. OP is retarded;3

Thank you for correcting me on these! I have taken them down. I will do more research in the future.;0

I agree it’s disrespectful to so blatantly disregard her parents wishes but yes, otherwise too uptight.;2
I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.;2
Where do you plan to go?;2
I just woke my wife up to make sure that she was okay before I could lay down.;0
Got a good laugh out of that. Plenty of wall of shame material.;3
THIS IS WHAT WE GET FOR RIPPING ON THE WILD ANIMAL SHITPOSTS;2
Playoffs are the most important games... hence why [NAME] is considered to be the best *regular season* QB and not the best;2
You can't release A New Hope 2.0 in China if you do that though.;2
"A ""Texas DUI"" sounds like a weird sex move. ";4
[NAME] was our second best hitter, [NAME] was the best;0

It's weird knowing that the people in these pictures are actually real You kinda forget sometimes;2
Title question: Obviously. As has already been mentioned in other threads this very day.;2
Agree completely with this statement;3
Only through surgery, steriods, and a high income. Personality is not a factor for woman, looks and status are;2
r/patrig Edit: looks like someone already cross posted it there. That was fast.;2
So, I saw the video yesterday. I think there are real complaints by residents, but that video isn't normal, and absolutely crosses into antisemitism.;1
Sorry but I didn’t throw in the towel for my co worker. These feelings were present before she entered my life.;1

Cheers, I live minutes away from you, will check it out some time soon.;3
Can't speak for the original commenter but probably not yours since I'd rather not be tortured for eternity for disbelief.;2
Not sure to downvote because genuine and encouraging or to upvote because sarcastic and hateful.;2
Yeah I want all our players to have a nice healthy hatred for Texas. Good way to ensure they get hyped to play em.;3
Super boogers is one of the super weird and oddly satisfying parts of recovery imo.;2

If reincarnation is real, I hope next time I have a name that's half as awesome as [NAME].;0
"No, it was believed that the baby absorbed maternal traits because the mother was the ""soil"" the ""seed"" grew in. ";1

Tell [NAME] it was me....;2
Yeah. I wish I had some stories like [NAME] but I’m also grad I don’t.;2
This is cursed;2
The only reason people are there is because they dont know [NAME] is fired lmao.;3
Just take them and get them vaccinated without his knowledge. Only one parent is needed. Dont even tell him after it's done.;0
He does not want to hear the plans that will work though.;2
Ok so the scape goat is gone. No more excuses now [NAME].;1
Go on...;3
