That game hurt.;4
You do right, if you don't care then fuck 'em!;2
Man I love reddit.;0
[NAME] was nowhere near them, he was by the Falcon. ;2
Right? Considering it’s such an important document, I should know the damned thing backwards and forwards... thanks again for the help!;0
He isn't as big, but he's still quite popular. I've heard the same thing about his content. Never watched him much.;1
"That's crazy; I went to a super [RELIGION] high school and I think I can remember 2 girls the entire 4 years that became teen moms.";3
that's adorable asf;3
"""Sponge Blurb Pubs Quaw Haha GURR ha AAa!"" finale is too real";3
I have, and now that you mention it, I think that's what triggered my nostalgia. ;2
I wanted to downvote this, but it's not your fault homie.;4
BUT IT'S HER TURN! /s;2
That is odd.;1
Build a wall? /jk;2
I appreciate it, that's good to know. I hope I'll have to apply that knowledge one day;0
One time my 1 stopped right in 91st, I was able to get a good photo of the platform since they have some lights along it.;2
Well then I’d say you have a pretty good chance if it’s any girl lol;2
Pretty much every Punjabi dude I've met.;0
For extra measure tape it right by your crotch so she can't take it for sexual assault reasons;1
This video doesn't even show the shoes he was wearing...;2
What does Clemson give pride stickers for? Snaps played?;2
"""You may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make""";0
Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.;0
this definitely fits in r/BoneAppleTea.;2
"""Seeeee! We have one of them coloureds too!""";3
RemindMe! 3 months;2
Yup, not anymore. Keep your blood sugar up! It really helps and DRINK water...;0
Lots, play store or apple store vpn. Nord is good;0
So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.;1
but it's [NAME] saying it so sorta disappointing;2
Something Something Something, space of aids;2
Dark and funny, but not really nice guy. He has yet to call the dead girls whores for declining to sleep with him. ;1
I've probably put a couple hundred miles on my space saver tire. It's still on there right now.;2
I’m glad he’s okay but I’m even gladder it’s not that same gif of the guy ski/parachuting down a mountain;0
nice!! I'll try this one;0
"I can't stand [NAME]. Especially since her ""tatooing my own face"" video. ";1
I just came home, what the fuck is this lineup? I love you [NAME] you mad bastard !!!;0
Go troll elsewhere. This woman needs support, not crass questions.;1
Just rumors online, it most likely won't happen;1
Na. Rediting my post. Sorry for the ignorance.;4
Because the content creators don't deserve to be paid, your seconds spent listening to ads are too valuable!;2
Pity. I had some decent lunches there, but never went there at night.;4
By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet;3
What evidence at all shows that [NAME] was an accomplice?;2
>not a cure-all. Since we don't have such a thing, is this not the next best option?;2
If there’s a pattern, yes.;3
If [NAME] has similar role to end year then no way am I taking those over him ...especially Sony;2
Oh whoops, I misread the original comment;2
Sending love and strength vibes <3;0
She’s like a kewpie doll with them. Precious.;0
Not knowing what it is, for one thing.;2
Thanks for the info mate gonna watch out next time;0
[NAME] is cheaper too. If we would have kept [NAME] we would have had to extend him to over $4mil.;2
Honestly at this point I don't think there's anything that will make me feel better. Maybe down the road, but right now nothing is helping. ;1
There has to be some repercussions for this judge, right? Considering the crimes, that bail seems incredibly low...;1
Good old guardian refusing to accept that [NAME] is stauncly anti-EU and anti-Brussels;1
I don’t even try to make shots like this myself. So I gotta watch other people make them.;4
Me too! First time in a couple of years!;3
Gotta protect’em!;0
Ironic. He could save others from secrecy-enabled corruption, but not himself.;2
This guy is basically the referee in parliament and your right to like him. As for the rest in there thats questionable;2
"""Oh, how DARE you discuss the disgustingly unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle I pursue!"" /s";1
Which totally makes it less funny for a person like me who has never seen this before, and laughed. ;3
Thanks, it was no effort at all.;0
Damn. That’s profound. Did you graduate from Harvard?;3
Nice. I'll look around for it. Thanks!;0
Press fucken charges the moment they use your info.;1
I love this woman.;0
Do you not give your snowmen brooms? I feel like that's a thing people do;1
The service made it 20 years ago (1999, yeah ikr 1999 was 20 YEARS AGO?) ;3
I loved how [NAME] feels like everyone in the office is her family. Her relationship with [NAME] is so cute and innocent;0
Then I’m sorry but this game really isn’t for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.;4
Who exactly are their ‘volunteers’? The IRA?;3
Am I the only INTP here who cared about deadlines. It's how I got so good at crunch time and working last minute.;2
You should dm her and say I'm sorry;2
>Did you just call me a liar? Sick reference.;1
Shut up 15 year-old;1
It doesn't matter. You can pick someone with the #1 Pick that will never be any good...;1
I feel this. For me since I’m using those gamethreads to let out frustration but realistically I know we need to keep patient in this re-rebuild;2
I just got a shirt made that says “I can’t have kids my dog is allergic”;3
I thought it was very good. The guy was one sick bastard that’s for sure.;0
This is kinda cute;0
10 life hacks you didn't know you needed in your life;2
Best side quest ever!;0
Calm down.;1
I wanted to know if there’s was another like meaning to the whole selfie thing not if she liked me or not;3
You're both wrong NBA is an initialism, can't be pronounced as a word. Oh man I love reddit;0
That's why it's only 20$;2
Just wait. Wait for the false promise. Wait for the mandatory prompts. Wait for the empty gestures.;2
Started feeling smug about my short showers but then remembered just how small my water heater is.;0
I didn't like the family ending but I liked the Atlantis ending especially as we know we are going to see more of it in DLC2.;3
Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done.;0
Is he dead now from a tragic drowning accident? Asking for a friend.;4
What? The claim is 2018 best shooters. Not overall best shooters;3
That's professor [NAME] to you, savage!;1
Let go or you will be dragged;0
No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it;0
Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.;4
She wants to connect, alright. With your wallet.;2
